    <header><h1>Update on my solar eclipse python project</h1></header>
    <p>I have made some changes to my <a href="https://github.com/Rampage2229/Solar-Eclipse-Forescast">solar eclipse forecaster script</a>. You can check it
    out on the Projects section of the website.</p>
    <p>The main upgrade of the new version is that now the script makes API calls to the Horizons database for
    each eclipse, instead of using the global call to estimate the eclipse. This way the first call (that
    requests data for the whole year) can have less frequency between observations (and thus be lighter
    and faster to process), and the data for each eclipse can be a ton more precise and still be faster
    than the previous method. Apart from that, the structure of the files has 
    changed up a bit, and there has been some bugfixing.</p>
    
    <p>I'm also planning on doing more changes to the website, especially finishing the About and Home pages, and maybe clearing the 
    Projects section.</p>
