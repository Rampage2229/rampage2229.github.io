    <p>Or blog post? I don't know what these things are called. Anyway,
    as my first post, I want to test some things and talk about the
    site.</p>
    <p>For example, <a href="https://i.upmath.me/latex.js">this script</a> from
    <a href="https://github.com/parpalak">Roman Parpalak</a> allows HTML pages
    to display <script  src="https://i.upmath.me/latex.js"></script> $$\LaTeX$$
    by converting LaTeX code into pictures in real time, which is really convenient
    for a site like this (that in theory should be filled up with
    math formulas, as that is what I do).
    </p>
    <p>
      As I expand the site and do more projects,
      the blog should start to fill up with interesting things.
      Right now, my main project <i>is</i> the website, and I am
      having a lot of fun with it. Having a space on the internet is
      something that more people should look into, regardless of their
      ability to code. Building a site is a lot easier than it appears,
      and there are <a href="https://discourse.32bit.cafe/t/resources-list-for-the-personal-web/49">
      lots of resources</a> available to make one from scratch, so I encourage you to
      give it a try.
