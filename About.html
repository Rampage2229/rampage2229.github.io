      <p>Hi! I am <b>Ramon</b>, an undergraduate math-phys student at 
      <a href="https://cfis.upc.edu/ca">CFIS</a>, at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC).
      I enjoy mathematics and physics, and I like to make some projects&mdash;like 
      this website&mdash;in my free time. You can contact me
       via email at <a href="mailto:roig.serra.ramon@gmail.com">roig.serra.ramon@gmail.com</a>.
      </p>
      <p>For the website, I am developing it on my own, and it is hosted on 
      <a href="https://github.com/Rampage2229/rampage2229.github.io">GitHub</a>.
      As you may see, the visual aspect of the webpage is really simple; I am not planning to change that, because
      it would go against the purpose of the site, to be a place for me to organize and log my projects
      and to host my curriculum, alongside some projects done by others that I may find interesting.
      <b>I am not a web developer</b>: I know the basics of HTML, CSS and some LaTeX. I don't need anything more
      for developing this website.
      </p>
